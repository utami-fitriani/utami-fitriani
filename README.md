ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Utami Fitriani.  

I'm a fresh QA Manual Tester with a background in Graphic Design and Video Animation. With the rapid changes happening in tech, Iâ€™m diving into the world of software development to balance my passion for creative design and tech. 

I have a keen eye for detail from my design days and always consider the userâ€™s perspective. Additionally, I bring strong documentation skills from my experience creating storyboards and scripts, which I now apply to writing clear test cases and bug reports.  

Iâ€™m just getting started in QA, but Iâ€™m ready to contribute, learn, and grow in this exciting field.
