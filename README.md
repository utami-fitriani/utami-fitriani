### **About me** 👋 

Hi, I’m Utami Fitriani. I'm a fresh QA Manual Tester with a background in Graphic Design and Video Animation. With the rapid changes happening in tech, I’m diving into the world of software development to balance my passion for creative design and tech. 

I have a keen eye for detail from my design days and always consider the user’s perspective. Additionally, I bring strong documentation skills from my experience creating storyboards and scripts, which I now apply to writing clear test cases and bug reports.  

I’m just getting started in QA, but I’m ready to contribute, learn, and grow in this exciting field. <br><br>
