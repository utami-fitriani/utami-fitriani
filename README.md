### **About me** üëã 

Hi, I‚Äôm Utami Fitriani. I'm a fresh QA Manual Tester with a background in Graphic Design and Video Animation. With the rapid changes happening in tech, I‚Äôm diving into the world of software development to balance my passion for creative design and tech. 

I have a keen eye for detail from my design days and always consider the user‚Äôs perspective. Additionally, I bring strong documentation skills from my experience creating storyboards and scripts, which I now apply to writing clear test cases and bug reports.  

I‚Äôm just getting started in QA, but I‚Äôm ready to contribute, learn, and grow in this exciting field. <br><br>
